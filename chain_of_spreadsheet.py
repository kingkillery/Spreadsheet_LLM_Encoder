INSTRUCTION:
Given an input that is a string denoting data of cells in a table. The input table contains many tuples, describing the cells with content in the spreadsheet. Each tuple consists of two elements separated by a '|': the cell content and the cell address/region, like (Year|A1), ( |A1) or (IntNum|A1:B3). The content in some cells such as '#,##0'/'d-mmm-yy'/'H:mm:ss',etc., represents the CELL DATA FORMATS of Excel. The content in some cells such as 'IntNum'/'DateData'/'EmailData',etc., represents a category of data with the same format and similar semantics. For example, 'IntNum' represents integer type data, and 'ScientificNum' represents scientific notation type data. 'A1:B3' represents a region in a spreadsheet, from the first row to the third row and from column A to column B. Some cells with empty content in the spreadsheet are not entered. How many tables are there in the spreadsheet? Below is a question about one certain table in this spreadsheet. I need you to determine in which table the answer to the following question can be found, and return the RANGE of the ONE table you choose, LIKE ['range': 'A1:F9'].

The text can be empty so the cell data is like 'A1, |A2,Profit'. The cells are organized in row-major order. The answer to the input question is contained in the input table and can be represented by cell address.
